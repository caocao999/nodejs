learning node.js


Someone says the best way to learn a programing language is to make something with it. I agree!  
Even though this is a tiny web server, it was a completely new experience for me.

Programing should be a fun.  It is suppose to be an excite experience. 
But I must accept sometimes programing is not a fun. 
People often write a program for money.  Facts of life!

At least this time I took a lot of joy from writing this a tiny program.
